CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindG2O.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "G2O", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "G2O" with any of
  the following names:

    G2OConfig.cmake
    g2o-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "G2O" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "G2O_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "G2O" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
